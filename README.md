<p> This is a memory game created with the scope of having 
    fun when taking a break from working, learning, etc. The strategy was to create a 
    game for the user to relax in a toning way for the mind. Memory-games are known to
    both entertain and exercise the main functions of the brain at all ages.
</p>
<p>
    The chosen theme is Astro-space, specifically planets from our Solar System. 
    The reason behind this theme choice is the fact that the subject related to space 
    and time infinity usually doesn't trigger negative emotions for people, but on the
     contrary, it gives them a feeling of trust and relief and helps to disconnect from the 
     daily routine.

<p>My personal scope of creating this memory game was learning how to juggle with javascript function
    and to better undestand the applicability of the powerfull tools that this intricate programming language
    has to offer. I have to admit that I have understood a big deal of logical javascript behaviour while 
    following these tutorials. They offered me big support during the creation of this project.</p>
